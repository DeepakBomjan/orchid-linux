## Basic Linux
### Lab Scenario: Organizing Your Project Files

1. **Create a New Directory:**
   - Navigate to your home directory.
   - Create a directory named `project`.
   - Navigate into the `project` directory.

2. **Create Subdirectories:**
   - Create two subdirectories named `docs` and `src`.

3. **Create Files in `docs` Directory:**
   - Navigate into the `docs` directory.
   - Create an empty file named `README.md`.
   - Create an empty file named `LICENSE`.
   - List the files to confirm they are created.

4. **Copy Files:**
   - Copy `README.md` to the `src` directory.
   - Navigate to the `src` directory to confirm the file was copied and list the contents.

5. **Move Files:**
   - Rename `README.md` in the `src` directory to `INTRO.md`.
   - Confirm the file was renamed by listing the directory contents.

6. **Remove Files:**
   - Remove the `LICENSE` file from the `docs` directory.
   - Navigate to the `docs` directory and confirm the file was removed by listing the contents.

7. **Remove Directories:**
   - Navigate to the parent `project` directory.
   - Remove the `docs` directory and its contents.
   - Confirm the directory was removed by listing the contents of the parent directory.

These lab questions guide students through creating directories, adding files, and using `cp`, `mv`, and `rm` commands in a structured exercise.

### Lab Scenario: Navigating Your Project Directory Tree

1. **Create a Directory Tree:**
   - Navigate to your home directory.
   - Create a directory named `project`.
   - Navigate into the `project` directory.
   - Within `project`, create two subdirectories named `docs` and `src`.
   - Inside the `docs` directory, create another directory named `guides`.
   - Inside the `src` directory, create a directory named `scripts`.

2. **Navigating the Directory Tree Using Relative Paths:**
   - From the `project` directory, navigate into the `docs` directory.
   - From `docs`, navigate into the `guides` directory.
   - From `guides`, navigate back to the `docs` directory.
   - From `docs`, navigate up to the `project` directory.
   - From `project`, navigate into the `src` directory.
   - From `src`, navigate into the `scripts` directory.

3. **Using Absolute Paths:**
   - Navigate to the `guides` directory using the absolute path from your home directory.
   - Navigate to the `scripts` directory using the absolute path from your home directory.

4. **Using `cd` Shortcuts:**
   - From any directory, navigate to your home directory.
   - From your home directory, navigate back to the last directory you were in.
   - From the `scripts` directory, navigate one level up to the `src` directory.
   - While in the `src` directory, navigate to the current directory (no change).
   - From any directory, navigate to the root directory of the file system.

These questions will guide students through creating a directory tree and practicing navigation using relative and absolute paths, along with `cd` shortcuts like `cd .`, `cd ..`, `cd -`, and `cd ~`.

Sure! Here are the lab questions focusing on getting command help, obtaining information about the current shell, and checking processes:

### Lab Scenario: Exploring Command Help and Shell Information

1. **Getting Command Help:**
   - How do you find out the options and usage of the `ls` command?
   - How can you display a brief description of the `cp` command?
   - How do you access the manual pages for the `mv` command to understand its usage?
   - How can you get a one-line description of the `rm` command?

2. **Getting Information About the Current Shell:**
   - How do you display the current terminal device name?
   - How can you find out which shell you are currently using?
   - How do you display the username of the currently logged-in user?

3. **Checking Running Processes:**
   - How do you list all currently running processes?
   - How can you display detailed information about a specific process?
   - How do you find the processes running by the current user?

4. **Extra Information:**
   - How do you display the current date and time?
   - How can you find out how long the system has been running?
   - How do you see a list of users currently logged into the system?

These lab questions guide students through using help commands, getting information about their current shell environment, and checking running processes.
